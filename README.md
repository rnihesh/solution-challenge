# CivicLemma

CivicLemma is a civic engagement platform designed to bridge the gap between citizens and municipal authorities in India. The platform enables citizens to report local infrastructure issues such as potholes, garbage dumping, fallen trees, illegal parking, and more by simply uploading a photo. An AI-powered classification system automatically identifies the type of issue, and the report is routed to the appropriate municipality for resolution. Municipalities can track, respond to, and resolve issues through a dedicated dashboard, while platform administrators have oversight over the entire system. A public leaderboard ranks municipalities based on their responsiveness, promoting transparency and accountability in local governance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js version 18.0.0 or higher
- Python version 3.9 or higher
- A Firebase project with Firestore and Authentication enabled
- Google Maps API key with Maps JavaScript API and Geocoding API enabled
- Cloudinary account for image uploads
- Google Gemini API key for AI description generation

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rnihesh/gdg-hackxtreme.git
cd gdg-hackxtreme
```

2. Install all Node.js dependencies:

```bash
npm run install:all
```

3. Set up the Python virtual environment for the ML service:

```bash
npm run install:ml
```

Note: the ML service requires Python 3.11 because TensorFlow does not install on Python 3.14 on Windows.

4. Download your Firebase service account key:
   - Go to Firebase Console
   - Navigate to Project Settings then Service Accounts
   - Click Generate New Private Key
   - Save the file as `server/serviceAccountKey.json`

5. Create environment files (see Environment Variables section below)
